similar molecules will have the same Morgan fingerprint (signnature) - locality sensitive hashing
Structure identification

moves visually similar numbers together
moliverse - molecule universe - very cool visualization by Asian Student that processed the PDFs

did it for images from PDFs to cluster similar spectra together
